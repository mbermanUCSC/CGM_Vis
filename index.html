            <p>*NOTE: Filtering by a date often produces sharp peaks and valleys. This is due to the infrequent poll rate of the sensor, common sensor errors, and
                simply not having enough collected data yet. </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my glucose monitoring Visualization! This contains real-time data from my Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system. 
            A CGM is a device that continuously tracks glucose (sugar) levels constantly. 
            This particular one sends updates every 6 minutes to a receiver or smartphone app, providing a detailed picture of my glucose levels to help manage my Type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p>Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the carbohydrates in the foods and drinks you consume, and is your body's main source of energy.
            Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas no longer produces insulin â€” a hormone that allows 
            your body to break down these sugar cells to serve as an energy source.
            Managing Type 1 diabetes requires careful monitoring of blood sugar levels to ensure they remain within a target range.
            A CGM system like the Dexcom G6 is an immense help for the management of my condition, as it helps track glucose levels more accurately and less invasively than traditional blood sugar testing methods.</p>
    
        <p>On this dashboard, you'll find a line chart that visualizes my glucose readings over time. Use the time filter control panel to explore fluctuations in my glucose levels at specific hours of the day. Adjust the slider to select an hour, and the chart will update to display the glucose levels for that hour across all recorded days.</p>
        
        <p>By sharing my data and experiences, I hope to offer insight into the daily management of Type 1 diabetes, and demonstrate the benefits of modern technology in diabetes care. Whether you are someone living with diabetes, a caregiver, or are simply interested in learning more, I at least hope you find this data I've produced just living my life to be interesting!</p>
